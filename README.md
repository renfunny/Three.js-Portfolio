## Description

Using Three.JS I have created a portfolio that showcases my experiences and my past projects while incorporating 3D models, animations, and a modern UI. This project helped me learn about Three.js and how it can be used to bring a website to life. I look forward to using this library in future projects.

This application uses:

- React
- JavaScript
- TailWind
- Three.js
